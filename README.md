## 100% AI-Created

VOIDSTRIKE is a fully AI-authored project. Every aspect was generated by artificial intelligence:

| Asset Type | AI-Generated |
|------------|--------------|
| **Code** | 85,000+ lines of TypeScript - engine, systems, UI, networking |
| **3D Models** | All units, buildings, terrain, and props |
| **Music** | Original soundtrack composed for each faction |
| **Voice Lines** | Unit responses, announcer, and ability callouts |
| **Sound Effects** | Weapons, explosions, ambient, and UI sounds |
| **Game Design** | Faction mechanics, unit balance, and map layouts |

No human-written code. No licensed assets. This is what happens when you point AI at the RTS genre and let it build.

## For RTS Players

### What Kind of Game Is This?

A competitive real-time strategy game in the style of StarCraft II, playable directly in your browser. No downloads, no installs - just click and play.

**Core Gameplay:**
- Gather resources, build bases, train armies, destroy your opponent
- Three unique factions with completely different playstyles
- Fog of war, high ground advantage, and strategic terrain
- Control groups, attack-move, patrol, and smart casting
- Multiplayer with ranked matchmaking (coming soon)

### The Factions

| Faction | Playstyle | If You Like... |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Dominion** | Defensive, siege-focused | Terran (SC2), GDI (C&C) |
| **Synthesis** | Mobile, tech-heavy | Protoss (SC2), NOD (C&C) |
| **Swarm** | Aggressive, swarm tactics | Zerg (SC2), Tyranids (40K) |

**Dominion** - Human military industrial complex. Tanks that siege, buildings that lift off, infantry that bunker up. Turtle and push.

**Synthesis** - Rogue AI collective. Warp-in instant deployment, energy shields, devastating psionic abilities. Hit hard, disappear, repeat.

**Swarm** - Biological nightmare. Cheap expendable units, creep that spreads across the map, everything morphs into something worse. Overwhelm with numbers.

### What Makes It Different?

- **Browser-native**: Runs in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox. No client download.
- **WebGPU graphics**: Modern rendering that rivals native games.
- **Deterministic replays**: Watch every game back, share with friends.
- **5-tier AI**: Practice against bots from beginner to brutal.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voidstrike.git
cd voidstrike
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in a modern browser (Chrome 113+ recommended for WebGPU).

## For Developers

### Why This Matters

Beyond being a playable game, VOIDSTRIKE is a **reference implementation** of modern game architecture patterns running entirely in the browser:

- **WebGPU-first rendering** with TSL shaders and WebGL2 fallback
- **Deterministic lockstep multiplayer** with fixed-point math
- **Industry-standard WASM pathfinding** (recast-navigation - same lib as Unity/Godot/Unreal)
- **Data-driven architecture** that separates engine from game content
- **85K lines of TypeScript** with strict mode, no `any` types in engine code

The codebase is structured so you can fork it to make a different RTS, extract individual systems as libraries, or study how specific problems are solved.

### Architecture

```
src/
├── engine/                 # Reusable game engine (~25K LOC)
│   ├── ecs/               # Entity-Component-System with archetype caching
│   ├── core/              # Game loop, EventBus, performance monitoring
│   ├── systems/           # Combat, movement, production, AI, etc.
│   ├── pathfinding/       # Recast Navigation WASM wrapper
│   └── network/           # WebRTC, lockstep, desync detection
│
├── rendering/             # Three.js WebGPU rendering (~15K LOC)
│   ├── tsl/              # TSL post-processing pipeline
│   └── *Renderer.ts      # Unit, building, terrain, effects
│
├── data/                  # Game configuration (swap this to make a different game)
│   ├── units/            # Unit definitions per faction
│   ├── buildings/        # Building definitions
│   ├── abilities/        # Ability definitions
│   └── maps/             # JSON map format with connectivity validation
│
└── components/            # React UI layer
```

The key insight: **everything in `src/data/` is game-specific, everything in `src/engine/` is reusable.** You could make a medieval RTS by changing the data files without touching engine code.

### What's Interesting

These are the parts that might be worth studying or extracting:

#### Archetype-Based ECS with Query Caching

Most ECS implementations invalidate query caches every frame. This one only invalidates when entity compositions change:

```typescript
// src/engine/ecs/World.ts
// Cache is keyed by component signature, invalidated on archetype changes only
private archetypes: Map<string, Set<Entity>> = new Map();
private queryCache: Map<string, Entity[]> = new Map();
private archetypeCacheVersion: number = 0;

getEntitiesWith(...components): Entity[] {
  const key = components.sort().join(',');
  if (this.queryCacheVersion === this.archetypeCacheVersion) {
    const cached = this.queryCache.get(key);
    if (cached) return cached;
  }
  // ... find matching archetypes, cache result
}
```

With 500 entities across 10 archetypes, this is ~50x faster than naive set intersection.

#### Web Worker Game Loop

Browsers throttle `requestAnimationFrame` in background tabs. This breaks multiplayer games. Solution: use a Web Worker for timing (Workers aren't throttled):

```typescript
// src/engine/core/GameLoop.ts
const workerCode = `
  setInterval(() => {
    self.postMessage({ type: 'tick', time: performance.now() });
  }, ${tickMs});
`;
this.worker = new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([workerCode])));
this.worker.onmessage = () => this.tick();
```

#### Per-Instance Velocity for TAA

Three.js's built-in `VelocityNode` doesn't work for `InstancedMesh` - it only tracks per-object transforms. This module stores both current and previous instance matrices as vertex attributes:

```typescript
// src/rendering/tsl/InstancedVelocity.ts
// Key insight: use IDENTICAL code paths for both matrices to eliminate precision jitter
const currInstanceMatrix = mat4(
  attribute('currInstanceMatrix0'),
  attribute('currInstanceMatrix1'),
  attribute('currInstanceMatrix2'),
  attribute('currInstanceMatrix3')
);
const prevInstanceMatrix = mat4(
  attribute('prevInstanceMatrix0'),
  // ...
);
// Velocity = project(curr) - project(prev)
```

#### Dual-Pipeline TAA + Upscaling

Combining TAA with resolution upscaling is notoriously tricky - depth buffer mismatches cause WebGPU errors. Solution: run all depth-dependent effects at render resolution, then upscale in a separate pipeline:

```typescript
// src/rendering/tsl/PostProcessing.ts
// INTERNAL PIPELINE @ 1440p: Scene → GTAO → SSR → Bloom → TRAA
// DISPLAY PIPELINE @ 2160p: Internal output → EASU upscale → Canvas
```

#### Fixed-Point Determinism

For lockstep multiplayer, floating-point arithmetic must produce identical results across browsers/CPUs. Q16.16 fixed-point ensures bitwise identical computations:

```typescript
// src/utils/FixedPoint.ts
export const FP_SHIFT = 16;
export const FP_SCALE = 1 << FP_SHIFT; // 65536

// 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3 in floating point
// But fpAdd(fpFromFloat(0.1), fpFromFloat(0.2)) is always identical everywhere
```

#### Recast Navigation Integration

Uses the same pathfinding library as Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine via WASM:

```typescript
// src/engine/pathfinding/RecastNavigation.ts
import { init, NavMesh, Crowd, TileCache } from 'recast-navigation';

// NavMesh from terrain geometry
const result = threeToTileCache([walkableMesh], config);

// O(1) path queries
const path = navMeshQuery.computePath(start, end);

// ORCA collision avoidance via DetourCrowd
crowd.addAgent(entityId, position, params);
crowd.update(deltaTime);
const state = crowd.getAgentState(entityId); // { x, y, vx, vy }
```

#### Map Connectivity Validation

Ensures all player bases can actually reach each other - catches the classic "designer forgot a ramp" problem:

```typescript
// src/data/maps/core/ConnectivityAnalyzer.ts
const analysis = analyzeConnectivity(mapData);
const result = validateConnectivity(analysis.graph);
// result.valid === false if any base is unreachable
```
