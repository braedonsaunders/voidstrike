The peninsulas are connected by land around the outer edge of the map, but this path is long and winding. The direct route between players is across the central ocean. Peninsulas are narrow enough that naval bombardment from the water can threaten inland structures. Small islands in the central ocean offer expansion opportunities for those who control the water.",
